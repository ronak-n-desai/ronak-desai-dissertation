% template.tex - version 0.9.1.1 (5/26/2011)
%
% This is a template file for the osudiss-2 class. See
% osudiss-2.pdf for documentation, and the GS material 
% for the requirements.
%
% Copy the following osudiss-2 files your latex path (or just the folder containing this file):
% osudiss-2.cls (v0.9.1)
% sa-draftwater.sty
%
% Then, to compile this file:
% latex template
% bibtex template
% latex template
% latex template
%
% (You can also use pdflatex if you prefer.)
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\documentclass[11pt, onehalf, phd]{osudiss-2} 
% Look at \DeclareOption in osudiss-2.cls for options to change oneside to twoside etc.
% The `11pt' option is unnecessary since it is the default

% `onehalf' sets the line spacing to one-and-a-half spacing instead of
% double spacing.

% The `phd' option is unnecessary since it is the default

% Remove `draft' option for final draft

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Packages %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Load your favorite packages here
\usepackage{graphicx} % for importing images in figures - you definitely want this!
\usepackage{lipsum} % for fake latin text---you probably don't want this

% For instance... see osudiss-2.pdf for some suggestions, if you don't
% have a clue
\usepackage{bm} % for bold math---useful
\usepackage{booktabs} % for more professional tables

%hyperref packages and options
\usepackage{bookmark} % helps booksmarks look better in PDF
%hypersetup option 'breaklinks' is reguired for line wrapping in the table of contents during latex compilation, and can be removed if you use pdflatex
\hypersetup{colorlinks=true,linkcolor=blue, breaklinks} %internal links in blue, citations in green
%\hypersetup{colorlinks=true,linkcolor=black, citecolor=black, breaklinks} %all links in black
\usepackage[all]{hypcap}

%Use of natbib is STRONGLY recommended to sort and compress your references within each citation
%With these options, natbib will convert i.e. [5,3,9,4] to [3-5, 9]
\usepackage[sort&compress]{natbib}

%required to have latex automatically generate subfigures (i.e. (a), (b) etc)
\usepackage{subfig}

\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{cleveref}
\usepackage{siunitx}

%load glossaries packages
%\usepackage[acronym, section=chapter]{glossaries}
\usepackage[acronym, automake, section=chapter]{glossaries} % recommended if supported by your OS
\makeglossaries %required to actually make a glossary
\include{acronyms}

%The following commands can be used to help deal with "overfull hbox" issues
%See, for example, http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=overfull for details
%\pretolerance 1000
\setlength{\emergencystretch}{3em}
%\tolerance 1000

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Custom Commands/Environments %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Put your favorite custom commands here
\newcommand{\fish}{\alpha} % some of my students call it the "fish" symbol

%Print list of abbreviations - use same font as List of Figures and List of Tables for the title, and same formatting in the table of contents.
% Argument #1 - title for list of abbreviations (i.e. List of Abbreviations)

\newcommand\PrintListofAbbreviations[1]{
\phantomsection
\addcontentsline{toc}{front}{\typesetColumnHeading{#1}}
\printglossary[type=\acronymtype,title={\protect {\typesetLevelTwo{#1}}}]
}

% Below is an example of customizing the style of headings in your
% dissertation. See osudiss-2.pdf for more information.
%
% For example, if you simply must have uppercase titles:
%\renewcommand\typesetLevelOne[1]{{\Large\textbf{\MakeUppercase{#1}}\par}}
%\renewcommand\typesetLevelTwo[1]{{\Large\textbf{\MakeUppercase{#1}}}}
% Note the \par for \typesetLevelOne
%
% If you want the title to be bold and |\Large| instead of |\Huge|:
%\renewcommand\titleFont{\normalfont\Large\bfseries}

% Add words that TeX may not know how to hyphenate below. This can
% help prevent overfull hboxes. For example,
\hyphenation{eigen-state space-time}
