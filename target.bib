The laser delivered up to 5.5 J (120 TW, 1.2 × 1021 W/cm2) laser energy on target at 0.5 Hz. A high repetition-rate Thomson parabola spectrometer measured the deuteron beam energy spectra on each shot for 60 sequential shots (two minutes). Peak fluxes of 5×1010 deuterons/sr/pulse, corresponding to an average flux of 1.5×1012 deuterons/sr/min, were demonstrated with deuteron energies reaching up to 4.4 MeV. High shot-to-shot stability is observed up to 40\%–50\% of the maximum deuteron energy. These deuteron beams are suited for fast neutron production through deuteron breakup in a converter yielding energies similar to deuteron–deuteron (D–D, 2.45 MeV) fusion reactions of importance for material damage studies.}",

	abstract = {A series of experiments were carried out using the 200 TW laser facility at LLP, SJTU aiming to explore parametric scalings of laser driven protons employing a low cost and stable high repetition rate tape drive target system. For numerous laser shots at a repetition rate of ∼0.2 Hz with maximum laser intensity up to ∼5 × 1019 W/cm2 maximum energy of protons were measured by varying laser energy, focal spot size and laser pulse duration. The data suggests that the maximum energy of protons scales as I∼0.6 while changing the incident laser energy. Scaling trends are in good agreement with the previously reported experimental results and theoretical models. This study may provide a platform to investigate the characteristics of proton beams, such as source size and angular dispersion at a repetition rate required for many potential applications.}

Faraday cup measurements record hundreds of pC charge accelerated to energies exceeding 120 keV, and energy-resolved measurements of secondary x-ray emissions reveal an x-ray spectrum peaking above 800 keV, which is significantly higher energy than previous studies with similar experimental conditions and more than five times the ∼110 keV ponderomotive energy scale for the laser. We show that the energetic x-rays generated in the experiment result from backward-going, high-energy electrons interacting with the focusing optic, and vacuum chamber walls with only a small component of x-ray emission emerging from the target itself. We also demonstrate that the high energy radiation can be suppressed through the attenuation of the nanosecond-scale pre-pulse. These results are supported by 2D particle-in-cell simulations of the laser-plasma interaction, which exhibit beam-like backward-propagating MeV electrons.}",
