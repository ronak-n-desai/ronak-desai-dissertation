	title = {Characterizing the acceleration time of laser-driven ion acceleration with data-informed neural networks},
	journal = {Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion},
	abstract = {Peak ion energy is an important figure-of-merit in short-pulse, laser-driven ion acceleration and is dependent on an associated acceleration time. Standard metrics for these quantities depend on analytical results such as the self-similar fluid model or empirical models based on relatively small experimental and simulation datasets. In this work we attempt to use a data-informed neural network (NN) as a surrogate model for a large ensemble of PIC simulations to investigate an effective acceleration time. We explore the application of a stacked convolutional and recurrent NN architecture for improved regression by incorporating the time dependencies of the data into the training process. Of particular note is how pretraining a network on lower fidelity data, e.g. 1D analytical results, greatly improves the network’s ability to learn more complex, higher fidelity data. Finally, the dependency of the acceleration time on various laser and plasma parameters is explored.}

	abstract = "{Developments in machine learning promise to ameliorate some of the challenges of modeling complex physical systems through neural-network-based surrogate models. High-intensity, short-pulse lasers can be used to accelerate ions to mega-electronvolt energies, but to model such interactions requires computationally expensive techniques such as particle-in-cell simulations. Multilayer neural networks allow one to take a relatively sparse ensemble of simulations and generate a surrogate model that can be used to rapidly search the parameter space of interest. In this work, we created an ensemble of over 1,000 simulations modeling laser-driven ion acceleration and developed a surrogate to study the resulting parameter space. A neural-network-based approach allows for rapid feature discovery not possible for traditional parameter scans given the computational cost. A notable observation made during this study was the dependence of ion energy on the pre-plasma gradient length scale. While this methodology harbors great promise for ion acceleration, it has ready application to all topics in which large-scale parameter scans are restricted by significant computational cost or relatively large, but sparse, domains.}",

Explored is an approach to ameliorate this deficiency using a multi-fidelity framework that can incorporate physical trends and phenomena at different levels. As the basis for this study, an ensemble of approximately 8000 1D simulations was generated to buttress separate ensembles of hundreds of higher fidelity 1D and 2D simulations. Using transfer learning with deep neural networks, one can reproduce the results of more complex physics at a much lower cost. The networks trained in this fashion can, in turn, act as surrogate models for the simulations themselves, allowing for quick and efficient exploration of the parameter space of interest. Standard figures-of-merit were used as benchmarks such as the hot electron temperature, peak ion energy, conversion efficiency, and so on. We can rapidly identify and explore under what conditions differing fidelities become an important effect and search for outliers in feature space.}",

	abstract = {We present results from a proof-of-principle experiment to optimize laser driven protons acceleration by directly feeding back its spectral information to a deformable mirror (DM) controlled by evolutionary algorithms (EAs). By irradiating a stable high-repetition rate tape driven target with ultra-intense pulses of intensities ∼1020 W/cm2, we optimize the maximum energy of the accelerated protons with a stability of less than ∼5% fluctuations near optimum value. Moreover, due to spatio-temporal development of the sheath field, modulations in the spectrum are also observed. Particularly, a prominent narrow peak is observed with a spread of ∼15% (FWHM) at low energy part of the spectrum. These results are helpful to develop high repetition rate optimization techniques required for laser-driven ion accelerators.}

A neural network (NN) incorporating uncertainty quantification is trained to predict the number of hot electrons generated by the laser–target interaction as a function of pulse shaping parameters. The predictions of this NN serve as the basis function for a Bayesian optimization framework to navigate this space. For post-experimental evaluation, we compare two separate neural network (NN) models. One is based solely on data from experiments, and the other is trained only on ensemble particle-in-cell simulations. Reviewing the predicted and observed trends across the experiment-capable laser parameter search space, we find that both ML models predict a maximal increase in hot electron generation at a level of approximately 12\\%–18\\%; however, no statistically significant enhancement was observed in experiments. On direct comparison of the NN models, the average discrepancy is 8.5\\%, with a maximum of 30\\%. Since shot-to-shot fluctuations in experiments affect the observations, we evaluate the behavior of our optimization framework by performing virtual experiments that vary the number of repeated observations and the noise levels. Here, we discuss the implications of such a framework for future autonomous exploration platforms in high-repetition-rate experiments.}",

Feature importance analysis using the trained models shows that specific aberrations in the laser wavefront are favored in generating higher beam charges, which reveals more information than the genetic algorithms and the statistical correlation do. The predictive models enable operations beyond merely searching for an optimal beam charge. The quality of the measured data is characterized, and anomaly detection is demonstrated. The model robustness against measurement errors is examined by applying a range of virtual measurement error bars to the experimental data.

	abstract = {Laser wakefield acceleration, a highly nonlinear process, can provide high-quality electron beams and betatron radiation. However, it has always been a challenge to optimize the photon number of betatron radiation because X-ray production is the secondary process followed by electron generation and many influential parameters are highly coupled with each other. To balance these parameters and optimize target value, we use a machine-learning algorithm called Bayesian optimization that ignores the complicated middle process and so is suitable to solve this kind of problems. Without designed initialization, we optimize betatron radiation in experiments by changing plasma density and laser focal position. The X-ray photon number doubles compared with initial condition within 10 iterations, which shows the rapidity of this algorithm. PIC simulation also illustrates the complexity of the optimization and reveals the reason why X-ray photon number increases.}

In this paper, we applied this method to two different experiments: (i) acceleration of electrons in laser driven plasma waves and (ii) self-compression of optical pulses induced by ionization nonlinearity. The manipulation of the laser wavefront leads to orders of magnitude improvement to electron beam properties such as the peak charge, beam divergence, and transverse emittance.
