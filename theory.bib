Characteristic features of the absorption process are an absorption efficiency of approximately 50\%, generation of suprathermal particles, and strong modification of the density profile in the vicinity of the critical density. The latter effect, the appearance of a finite density variation over the distance of a few Debye lengths, is forced by strong gradients in the plasma wave intensity and electron temperature. Such a density discontinuity greatly enhances the range of incidence angles for which resonance absorption is effective and decreases the effects of the oscillating two‐stream and ion‐acoustic decay instabilities.},

In this report, an attempt is made to explain the physical process present that will explain the presence of these energetic protons, as well as explain the number, energy, and angular spread of the protons observed in experiment. In particular, we hypothesize that hot electrons produced on the front of the target are sent through to the back off the target, where they ionize the hydrogen layer there. These ions are then accelerated by the hot electron cloud, to tens of MeV energies in distances of order tens of μm, whereupon they end up being detected in the radiographic and spectrographic detectors.}",

This process has been shown to take place via the so-called Target Normal Sheath Acceleration (TNSA) mechanism. A fundamental challenge in the investigation of this phenomenon is to understand the dependencies of the ion beam features on the laser and target properties. In order to achieve this goal, several TNSA theoretical models have been proposed. In the present work a collection of maximum ion energies experimentally measured has been compared to the values predicted by six different theoretical descriptions. The models we chose to compare are based either on a fluid approach, on a quasi-static approach, or on a combination of the before-mentioned. On the basis of such a quantitative comparison we aim to provide a reliable test of these theoretical descriptions, in which their strengths, weaknesses, open problems and capability in predicting the ion energy are underlined.}

Nowadays, most of all the published experimental results can be theoretically explained in the framework of the target normal sheath acceleration (TNSA) mechanism proposed by Wilks et al. [Phys. Plasmas 8(2), 542 (2001)10.1063/1.1333697]. As an alternative to numerical simulation various analytical or semi-analytical TNSA models have been published in the latest years, each of them trying to provide predictions for some of the ion beam features, given the initial laser and target parameters. However, the problem of developing a reliable model for the TNSA process is still open, which is why the purpose of this work is to enlighten the present situation of TNSA modeling and experimental results, by means of a quantitative comparison between measurements and theoretical predictions of the maximum ion energy. Moreover, in the light of such an analysis, some indications for the future development of the model proposed by Passoni and Lontano [Phys.

Electrostatic shocks are driven by the interaction of two plasmas with different density and/or relative drift velocity. The energy and number of ions reflected by the shock increase with increasing density ratio and relative drift velocity between the two interacting plasmas. It is shown that the interaction of intense lasers with tailored near-critical density plasmas allows for the efficient heating of the plasma electrons and steepening of the plasma profile at the critical density interface, leading to the generation of high-velocity shock structures and high-energy ion beams. Our results indicate that high-quality 200 MeV shock-accelerated ion beams required for medical applications may be obtained with current laser systems.}",

	abstract = "{The propagation of short‐pulse lasers through underdense plasmas at ultra‐high intensities (I≥1019 W/cm) is examined. The pulse evolution is found to be significantly different than it is for moderate intensities. The pulse breakup is dominated by leading edge erosion and plasma wave wake formation rather than from Raman forward scattering type instabilities. A differential equation which describes local pump depletion is derived and used to analyze the formation and evolution of the erosion. Pulse erosion is demonstrated with one dimensional particle in cell (PIC) simulations. In addition, two dimensional simulations are presented which show pulse erosion along with other effects such as channeling and diffraction. Possible applications for plasma based accelerators and light sources are discussed.}",
