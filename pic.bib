	abstract = {We have investigated the nearest grid point (NGP) and the cloud in cell (CIC) particle models of a plasma, together with two other models obtained from the above by smoothing the potential before use (HNGP and HCIC models). The collision time is found to be only slightly dependent on the model and is given to 20 % by (τcoll/τpe) = n(λD2 +W2), where n is the density and W the width of the particles (W = H, the mesh spacing for NGP and CIC; W = 2H for HNGP and HCIC). The ratio of electric-field energy to particle energy is given by 〈E2〉/8π ÷ nmvth2 = 0.12/n(λD2 + W2). Stochastic heating due to the finite size of the space mesh and the time step DT is correlated as a function of H/λD and ωpeDT. An optimum path in this parameter plane is found to be (wpeDT)opt= min [12H/λD, 1]. On this path the ratio of the heating time (the time for the average kinetic energy of an electron to increase by 12kT) to the collision time is (τH/gtcoll) = K2/(H/λD)2, where K2 = 2.1 (NGP), 6.4 (HNGP), 41 (CIC), 200 (HCIC). The models are compared on the basis of the cost in computer time per square collisionless plasma period per mesh cell. If we permit computing provided (τH/τcoll) > 10 (or better than 2.5 % energy conservation in a collision time) then the most economic model to use is given by the tableau: 0 ← NGP → 0.45 ← HNGP → 0.8 ← CIC → 2.0 ← HCIC → 4.5, where the name of the model is written between the values of H/λD for which it is best suited. Alternatively, if we accept a model provided (τH/τcoll) > 1 (or better than 25% energy conservation in a collision time), then the favoured ranges for the different models are 0 ← NGP → 1.5 ← HNGP → 2.5 ← CIC → 6.5 ← HCIC → 14. None of the models considered may be used for H/λD > 14.}

This solver is adapted for use in dense plasma simulation through the direct implicit scheme. The new implicit field solver involves two half-timestep field advances with convenient time centering for the ∇×E and ∇×B terms. Although making use of the alternating direct implicit technique, the new solution technique is faster because no iterations are required.}

	title = {Contemporary particle-in-cell approach to laser-plasma modelling},
	journal = {Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion},
	abstract = {Particle-in-cell (PIC) methods have a long history in the study of laser-plasma interactions. Early electromagnetic codes used the Yee staggered grid for field variables combined with a leapfrog EM-field update and the Boris algorithm for particle pushing. The general properties of such schemes are well documented. Modern PIC codes tend to add to these high-order shape functions for particles, Poisson preserving field updates, collisions, ionisation, a hybrid scheme for solid density and high-field QED effects. In addition to these physics packages, the increase in computing power now allows simulations with real mass ratios, full 3D dynamics and multi-speckle interaction. This paper presents a review of the core algorithms used in current laser-plasma specific PIC codes. Also reported are estimates of self-heating rates, convergence of collisional routines and test of ionisation models which are not readily available elsewhere. Having reviewed the status of PIC algorithms we present a summary of recent applications of such codes in laser-plasma physics, concentrating on SRS, short-pulse laser-solid interactions, fast-electron transport, and QED effects.}
