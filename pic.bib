	abstract = {The implementation of an implicit electromagnetic field solver in the particle-in-cell code Lsp is presented. This solver is adapted for use in dense plasma simulation through the direct implicit scheme. The new implicit field solver involves two half-timestep field advances with convenient time centering for the ∇×E and ∇×B terms. Although making use of the alternating direct implicit technique, the new solution technique is faster because no iterations are required.}

	title = {Contemporary particle-in-cell approach to laser-plasma modelling},
	journal = {Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion},
	abstract = {Particle-in-cell (PIC) methods have a long history in the study of laser-plasma interactions. Early electromagnetic codes used the Yee staggered grid for field variables combined with a leapfrog EM-field update and the Boris algorithm for particle pushing. The general properties of such schemes are well documented. Modern PIC codes tend to add to these high-order shape functions for particles, Poisson preserving field updates, collisions, ionisation, a hybrid scheme for solid density and high-field QED effects. In addition to these physics packages, the increase in computing power now allows simulations with real mass ratios, full 3D dynamics and multi-speckle interaction. This paper presents a review of the core algorithms used in current laser-plasma specific PIC codes. Also reported are estimates of self-heating rates, convergence of collisional routines and test of ionisation models which are not readily available elsewhere. Having reviewed the status of PIC algorithms we present a summary of recent applications of such codes in laser-plasma physics, concentrating on SRS, short-pulse laser-solid interactions, fast-electron transport, and QED effects.}
